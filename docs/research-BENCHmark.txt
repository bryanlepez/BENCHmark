## Deep Research Request: Lifter-Friendly Macro Tracker (Web MVP)

<context>
I’m building a modern, fast calorie + macro tracking web app for gym lifters.

**My skills:** Some Python + Java; beginner with frameworks. I can read/understand code and am willing to learn React.
**Goal:** A usable MVP in 2 weeks.
**Budget:** Under $50/month.
**Differentiation:** Speed + clean UI + accurate food search + lifter-friendly experience.
**Competitor impressions:** 
- MyFitnessPal: strong database/accuracy/options but clunky UI
- Cronometer: better UI but weaker food search

### Research Objectives
Help me choose a practical, modern, scalable approach to build a web MVP quickly (2 weeks) with:
- Fast food lookup + autocomplete
- Add/edit/remove items in a daily log
- Auto-calc daily macro totals
- Store daily logs historically and allow editing past days
- Large, accurate searchable food database
- Auth/accounts + cloud sync
- Decide offline-first vs online-first

### Core Questions to Answer (be concrete)
1. **Food database options (most important):**
   - Compare: USDA FoodData Central, Open Food Facts, Nutritionix, Edamam, FatSecret, Spoonacular, etc.
   - Which options are best for:
     - Search quality + breadth
     - Data accuracy (especially branded vs generic foods)
     - Barcode support (now or later)
     - Pricing that can fit under $50/month at MVP scale
   - Provide a recommended “MVP choice” + a “scale-up choice”.
   - Include current rate limits/pricing and any key restrictions.

2. **Search UX + performance:**
   - Best-practice patterns for instant search/autocomplete (debounce, caching, prefix matching, ranking).
   - Suggested approach for:
     - API-backed search (typeahead)
     - Handling duplicates/variants (same food entries)
     - Favorites / recent foods to speed logging
   - Clear guidance for keeping the UI fast on mobile browsers.

3. **Data model for daily logs (editable history):**
   - Recommend a schema for:
     - Users
     - Foods (cached references vs raw snapshots)
     - Log entries (with grams/servings, timestamps)
     - Daily totals (computed vs stored)
   - How to support editing past days safely, and prevent “food data changed” issues:
     - Should log entries store a snapshot of macros at time of logging?
     - How to handle recipe/serving changes?
   - Include example tables/collections and relationships.

4. **Auth + cloud sync:**
   - Compare Supabase vs Firebase vs “roll your own” for a React web app MVP.
   - Recommend the fastest-to-ship option that is still scalable.
   - Include security basics (RLS policies if Supabase, rules if Firebase).

5. **Offline-first vs online-first:**
   - For a 2-week MVP: recommend online-first with small offline enhancements OR true offline-first.
   - If offline support is recommended:
     - What’s the simplest approach (service worker, local storage/IndexedDB, sync queue)?
     - What are the main pitfalls?

6. **Recommended stack for my skill level (modern + scalable):**
   - Provide 2 stack options:
     - **MVP-fast option** (optimize for shipping in 2 weeks)
     - **Modern-scalable option** (best long-term structure)
   - For each: frontend, backend, database, auth, hosting, and food API integration.
   - Include a short architecture diagram (Mermaid or text).

7. **MVP scope + 2-week build plan:**
   - Define “must-have” vs “nice-to-have” (barcode scanning likely later).
   - Provide a day-by-day or week-by-week plan with deliverables.
   - Provide “definition of done” checks aligned to success metrics:
     - Log food quickly
     - Auto-calc daily macros
     - Large searchable foods

### Required Deliverables
1. **Competitor + Data Source Table**
   - Food data source, features (branded/generic/barcode), pricing, rate limits, pros/cons, best use case.

2. **Architecture Recommendation**
   - MVP-fast and modern-scalable stacks with pros/cons + estimated complexity.

3. **Data Model**
   - Suggested schema (SQL tables or NoSQL collections) + rationale.

4. **Search UX Plan**
   - Autocomplete approach, ranking, caching, performance tactics.

5. **2-Week MVP Roadmap**
   - A practical implementation plan with clear milestones.

### Output Format Requirements
- Use tables for comparisons.
- Provide clear recommendations (not just options).
- Include source URLs with access dates for:
  - Pricing, rate limits, API terms
  - Key technical guidance
- Explicitly note any uncertainty or disagreements between sources.
